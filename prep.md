. Fix overcrowding issues
. ad calender swap animations
. stop editing form if you chang epriority or delete white the form is open
. blank days should be showing past and future month todos
. show how many days left until selected date

Drawbacks of current structure:

1. There is one submit form, and one todo wrapper.
   -> If we were to geretate those dynamically, we would have to
   reassign the html targets and event listeners
