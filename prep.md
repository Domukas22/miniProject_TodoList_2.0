Left to do:

2. Edit priorities / text
3. Upload icons
4. The destructuring doesnt hav eto happen in sequence. Remove all obj.properties, and replace with deconstruction

1. There is one submit form, and one todo wrapper. 
-> If we were to geretate those dynamically, we would have to
    reassign the html targets and event listeners
